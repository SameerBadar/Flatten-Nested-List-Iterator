This program is a C++ implementation that takes a nested list as a string input, represented as a list of integers with nested lists enclosed in square brackets. It then converts the input string into a nested list using a queue-based LinkedList approach.

The program first initializes an empty queue and iterates through the input string, enqueuing each integer and creating new nested lists when it encounters square brackets. Once the input string has been fully processed, the program dequeues the elements from the queue and stores them in a dynamically allocated array, which is then displayed as the final nested list.

The program includes a helper function displayList() that takes an integer array and its size as input and prints the elements as a nested list.

To use this program, simply compile and run it with the desired input string as a command-line argument. The program will then output the corresponding nested list.

Note: This program uses a custom queue.h header file for the LinkedList implementation. Make sure to include this file in the project directory before compiling.
